## Usage Guidelines

This document is maintained by the Chief Design Officer and serves as the authoritative reference for all design-related decisions. The DSD ensures that our design language remains consistent, accessible, and aligned with our brand values across all touchpoints.

When implementing components or patterns, always refer to the relevant DSD section to ensure compliance with our established standards.

## Contributing

The DSD is a living document that evolves with our product. While the Chief Design Officer has primary responsibility for maintaining it, valuable input from the broader team is welcome.

When proposing changes to the DSD:

1. Ensure they align with our overall design principles and brand values
2. Consider the impact on existing implementations and user experience
3. Provide a clear rationale for the proposed changes
4. Include visual examples when applicable

All changes must be approved by the Chief Design Officer before being incorporated into the official DSD.

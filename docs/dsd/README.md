# Fable Design System Document (DSD)

This directory contains the Design System Document (DSD), which is the single source of truth for all design decisions at Fable.

## Structure

The DSD is organized into the following sections:

1. [Brand Identity](./01-brand-identity.md) - Logo, colors, typography, tone and voice
2. [Design Principles](./02-design-principles.md) - Core values and guidelines
3. [Design Tokens](./03-design-tokens.md) - Colors, typography, spacing, shadows, etc.
4. [Components](./04-components.md) - UI component specifications
5. [Patterns](./05-patterns.md) - Interaction and layout patterns
6. [Accessibility](./06-accessibility.md) - WCAG compliance standards
7. [Platform Guidelines](./07-platform-guidelines.md) - Mobile and web-specific considerations

## Purpose

The DSD serves as:

- The definitive reference for all design decisions
- A tool for ensuring consistency across all Fable products
- Documentation for onboarding new team members
- A living document that evolves with the product

## Governance

All changes to the DSD must be reviewed by the Chief Design Officer. The DSD is maintained with rigorous discipline and precision to ensure the integrity of Fable's design ecosystem.
